## Exp 2: Testing Wukong with random message delay

### Setting:

- node number: $n=10$
- favorable situation: $f=0$
- $\Delta$: 1s
- Random message delay: Each message has a 10% probability of incurring a 50-millisecond delay.

### Results:

- Pic1: Latency v.s.batch size
- Pic2: Throughput v.s. batch size
- Pic3: Latency v.s. throughput

The three pictures show that even with random message delays, Wukong still outperforms the others by a significant margin.
